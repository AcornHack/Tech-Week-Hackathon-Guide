## What is Covid-19 Online Hackathon?

The Teens in AI COVID-19 Global Hackathon is an opportunity for young people aged 12-24 and the wider machine learning community to join the global movement that drives social impact, with the aim of tackling some of the challenges related to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\
\
We are encouraging young innovators around the world to build solutions using data science and machine learning technologies across a range of challenge areas.\
\
With the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic, governments have issued guidance for members of the community to practice social distancing, while companies have enforced work from home policies in an effort to flatten the curve of viral infections across the population. Most schools are closed and young people are stuck indoors so why not invest some of your free time into making a difference to the world from home.

Given the isolation currently being experienced within communities right now, we want to create an online space where young people can ideate, experiment and build software solutions to help address this crisis.



## Challenges - UN Sustainable Development Goals



Health & Wellness– How might we protect healthcare systems and our mental health during the outbreak?

We are facing a health crisis that will likely have a lasting impact on our health services. This virus is already overwhelming our healthcare systems which means there is a reduced access to regular treatments (such as cancer surgery being pushed back), jeopardising public health on an even larger scale.

This crisis can also have negative impacts on our mental health. A sudden change in circumstances can be mentally challenging, whether it’s the loss of a job, new pressures on relationships with the people around you, the loss of a loved one or even just being stuck indoors all the time can have detrimental impacts. Very few of us have experienced a pandemic like this so many people may feel more confused than ever.

Everyone is now more conscious of their health as well as others and it’s becoming a greater concern everyday. How can we use technology to support our health as well as create a long term positive impact?



Education– How might we be improve the quality of online education during the outbreak?

Schools across the world have suddenly been closed and teachers are urgently rethinking how to teach effectively online.

Education is one of the most powerful things we have it allows the growth of humanity. However, since schools have now shut, teachers are desperately trying to keep their students engaged during online classes but it just isn’t the same as being in a school environment.

In countries which are less digitally connected there may be a bigger impact on students compared to students in countries with full access to the internet. As well as this there may be an increase in home difficulties among students who depend on free school meals or have younger siblings as they won’t be able to focus on school work as well.

How can technology change online education for the better and possibly have an impact on the way we learn in the future?



Empowerment– How might we rapidly inform and empower communities around the world to stay safe and healthy during the outbreak?

This pandemic is starting to affect most people, but those among the poorest and vulnerable will be impacted more than others.A large proportion of our population has been lifted out of poverty over the past few years but we still live in a world full of inequalities. Poorer people are likely to find it much harder to stay safe during this pandemic as they will be reluctant to quit their jobs so will still be going out and putting themselves at risk.

One particular area of concern affects the safety of women. Lockdown measures are predicted to result in a rise in domestic violence, which will be made worse by the fact that there may be fewer opportunities to find safety and authorities may have fewer resources to help. How can we come together through this crisis and achieve greater equality and access to opportunities instead?



Supporting vulnerable groups– How might we support ‘high risk’ groups during COVID-19?

People who are considered ‘high risk’ such as people with underlying medical conditions and the elderly may be struggling more than anyone else during this pandemic.

With many countries experiencing an ageing population and many people suffering from medical conditions it seems there is a massive percentage of vulnerable people across the world. These groups are likely to feel more negative impacts than anyone else such as loneliness and fear. As well as this they may not have family to deliver them food and will rely on others to help them.



Environment– How might we take better care of our environment when the pandemic is over?

Measures to combat coronavirus have helped reduce pollution dramatically. We now need to figure out how to continue doing so.

Before this coronavirus pandemic began, our planet was already in a climate crisis – although with less consensus about the urgency of the issue and less cooperation aimed at solving it.

Now, measures to combat coronavirus have unintentionally helped our environment as pollution has reduced dramatically. Will our planet return to its previous ways after this crisis or will we discover a new appreciation for our temporarily cleaner world, as well as new ideas to work together to clean it up even more?

## 2. Ethics in AI[¶](https://teensinai.com/hackathon-guide/#2_ethics_in_ai)

Recent advances in computing may place us at the threshold of a unique turning point in human history. Soon we are likely to partly entrust the management of our environment, economy, security, infrastructure, food production, healthcare, and to a large degree even our personal activities, to artificially intelligent computer systems.

The role of Facebook’s “Free Basics” in Myanmar genocide and the Cambridge Analytica fiasco are only some of the dire situations where data has been exploited for horrendous activities. The blame game is only a part of post-mortem. The policy changes usually take place as a face-saving manoeuvre.

It is therefore extremely crucial for the key players in AI and also for the aspirants to have an education imbued with the awareness of responsibilities that come with such expertise.

## 5. Tips for Pitch Video[¶](https://teensinai.com/hackathon-guide/#5_tips_for_pitch_video)

Your pitch video is a core component of your TeensInAI submissions, and should be a maximum of three (3) minutes.

You should aim to communicate your business canvas, demonstrate your product, and engage would-be users in 3 minutes. Use the video medium to create excitement and demand for your solution. What evidence can you provide or discuss that adds credibility to your team and your solution? Do you need more resources to take it to the next level – would your video attract crowd funding, the interest of an angel investors or philanthropist – or just get you on the news?

Your pitch video should include:

* Research Theme: How does your project relate to one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?
* Problem: What problem does your project solve?
* Vision: What is the vision for your business or product?
* Solution and Unique Value Proposition: How do you solve the problem you just defined? What is the unique value about your solution?
* Target Market: Who are you aiming this product at? How will it benefit them?
* product demo: Show us how your product works! What are its core technologies? Give us a demo!
* Project Team: Show us your team with their names and roles!

Your pitch video could include (if you have time):

* Market statistics of the industry your product or service will be a part of.
* Feedback or user stories surrounding your product/service.
* Short term (1 year) and long term (5 year) plans.
* Financial breakdown of costs including how much you would need from an investor.

Some interesting points to consider when making your video:

* Is your video showcasing the product/service and convincing to the viewer?
* Do you clearly identify the target market with justification?
* Do you convincingly explain why this idea is needed with justification?
* Do you showcase why this product/service is interesting?

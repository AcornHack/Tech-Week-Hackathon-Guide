# **FAQs for Educators:**

## **What is a Hackathon?**

Traditionally, hackathons are technology development marathons that draw on the talents and initiative  of bright-minded volunteers â€“such as software developers, engineers, technologists, designers,
 scientists, and anyone with a passion and desire to have an immediate impact on the world.

Hackathons are open to anyone, and are focused on developing real solutions to global challenges by
 the end of the event.

Teens in AI Hack is a pilot project run over 2 weeks in partnership with Founders4Schools and CogX. It aims to
 inspire young people ages 11-18 into artificial intelligence and offer a chance to solve problems
 affecting humanity. At Teens in AI hackathons, young people lead the process and are guided by
 mentors to solve problems.

## **How do I enter a team?**

# **Teens in AI Hackathon Guide**

!!! Info
	This site provides much of the information you'll need to prepare your Teens in AI Hack competition entries, and links to resources to help you create a great project.

## **What is Teens In AI London Tech Week Hackathon?**

To celebrate London Tech Week, [Founders4Schools](https://www.founders4schools.org.uk/about/), [Teens in AI](https://teensinai.com/) and [CogX](https://cogx.co/) are running a Hackathon to inspire young people aged 11-18 into Artificial Intelligence.

We are on a mission to encourage young people to pursue computing and technology, and promote diversity in this ever-growing field.

Diverse teams of 2-4 students will be designing a product that addresses one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Challenges with the use of AI, they will then go on to develop this product and create a short 3-minute video pitching this product.

## **Challenges**

This year we are focusing on [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). Within their teams, young people can 
Focus on any one of the goals and tackle them using open source machine learning tools.

## **Judging Criteria**

Our panel of judges will analyse projects based on the criteria listed below. They will base their judgement on both the product you produce, the code you write and your video pitch.

* **Design & Implementation** - Does it work? Is it implementable? Did the team think about the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)?
  Was the product designed with humans in mind?
* **Innovation:** How innovative / creative / unique is the idea? Was there a novel approach applied to solve the problem?
* **Technical Complexity** - Is the project technically impressive? Complex? 
  How technically sophisticated / advanced / elegant was the solution?
* **Social Impact** - How impactful is the idea? Can it impact the lives of many people in a significant way? Is the idea aligned with and addresses any of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?  
* **Commercial Viability** - Is there a business potential?
  How original is the business model? Has the team considered route to market and has made proactive actions to execute an action plan?  Is the idea feasible, does it have economic and societal value,
   and is it sustainable?

## **2. Ethics in AI**

## **3. Human-Centred Design**

Human-centered design is a creative approach to problem solving and the backbone of a product. It’s a process that starts with the people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs.

[Download our Human Centred Design Guide (PDF)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zpjIXhG5X6DtwytUJwC8UqgG-SibMXEU)

## **4. Business Model Canvas**

The Business Model Canvas (BMC), is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool. It allows you to describe, design, challenge, invent, and pivot your business model.

A good starting place is on the [Strategyzer](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas) sites. Strategyzer have a lot of free resources on their site, but you'll need to register to access them.

## **5. Tips for Pitch Video**

Your pitch video is a core component of your TeensInAI submissions, and should be a maximum of three (3) minutes.

You should aim to communicate your business canvas, demonstrate your product, and engage would-be users in 3 minutes. Use the video medium to create excitement and demand for your solution. What evidence can you provide or discuss that adds credibility to your team and your solution? Do you need more resources to take it to the next level – would your video attract crowd funding, the interest of an angel investors or philanthropist – or just get you on the news?

**Your pitch video should include:**

* Research Theme: How does your project relate to one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?
* Problem: What problem does your project solve?
* Vision: What is the vision for your business or product?
* Solution and Unique Value Proposition: How do you solve the problem you just defined? What is the unique value about your solution?
* Target Market: Who are you aiming this product at? How will it benefit them?
* product demo: Show us how your product works! What are its core technologies? Give us a demo!
* Project Team: Show us your team with their names and roles!

**Your pitch video could include (if you have time):**

* Market statistics of the industry your product or service will be a part of.
* Feedback or user stories surrounding your product/service.
* Short term (1 year) and long term (5 year) plans.
* Financial breakdown of costs including how much you would need from an investor.

**Some interesting points to consider when making your video:**

* Is your video showcasing the product/service and convincing to the viewer?
* Do you clearly identify the target market with justification?
* Do you convincingly explain why this idea is needed with justification?
* Do you showcase why this product/service is interesting?

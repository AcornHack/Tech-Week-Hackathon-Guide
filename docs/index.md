# **Teens in AI Hackathon Guide**

!!! Info
This site provides much of the information you'll need to prepare your Teens in AI Hack competition entries, and links to resources to help you create a great project.

## **What is Teens In AI London Tech Week Hackathon?**

To celebrate London Tech Week, [Founders4Schools](https://www.founders4schools.org.uk/about/), [Teens in AI](https://teensinai.com/) and [CogX](https://cogx.co/) are running a Hackathon to inspire young people aged 11-18 into Artificial Intelligence.

We are on a mission to encourage young people to pursue computing and technology, and promote diversity in this ever-growing field.

Diverse teams of 2-4 students will be designing a product that solves a challenge proposed with the use of AI, they will then go on to create this product and create a short 3-minute video pitching this product.

## **Challenges**

This year we are focusing on [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). Within their teams, young people can
Focus on any one of the goals and tackle them using open source machine learning tools.

## **Judging Criteria**

Our panel of judges will analyse projects based on the criteria listed below. They will base their judgement on both the product you produce, the code you write and your video pitch.

- Implementation
- Originality
- Technical Complexity
- Social Impact

## **Prizes**

- **Pitch at [CogX](https://cogx.co)** - Pitch your project at CogX to investors, developers and industry experts. You never know, a good pitch could get your business up and running in no time!

## **How to Enter - Educators**

1. Create teams of 2-4 students - max 2 teams per school
2. Run an event 10-24 May and invite mentors (2-3 machine learning and artificial intelligence Developers, 1-2 Design Thinkers, 1-2 Entrepreneurs, 1-2 Ethicists) to ideate and help you submit videos by 24 May on DevPost
3. If your team is selected into 20 Finalist teams, it will be invited to CogX AI Festival for inspiration on Monday morning 10 June
4. Teams will return to school and can carry on building/modifying their projects with the help of mentors (optional)
5. Teams return to CogX on 12th June 9 am for Demo Day
6. Winners announced at CogX

# **DevPost**

Teens in AI Hack will use [DevPost](https://devpost.com) to manage project submissions for judging. DevPost is a free service for managing hackathons and project pages.

## **You will need to do the following:**

Register all participants for the Teens in AI hackathon in DevPost. To do this click the \[Register for this hackathon] button on the Teens in AI page, and sign up. Once you have created a DevPost account you will be able to create project pages.

Create a DevPost project page for your Teens in AI project - you can do this via the \[Enter a submission] button on the Teens in AI page, or via your Portfolio in DevPost.

Submit your DevPost project to the Teens in AI hackathon

## **When creating and editing your DevPost project make sure you:**

Invite your team members onto the project via email.

Describe your project thoroughly in the "Here's the whole story" section.

Put the links to your app and other resources (such as your BMC, screengrabs, etc.) in the "Try it out" field. You can add multiple links.

Upload images, such as screenshots, in the "Image Gallery"

Put the URL of your pitch video in the "Video demo"

You can also upload a zip file when you submit your project.

**Submitting your project**

**<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vCa7QFFthfU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>**

# **GitHub**

Teams will upload all code to GitHub. GitHub is a tool that developers and teams use to work together on their projects. You must use GitHub to store your code. Doing this is very simple. You must also attach a README.md to GitHub with instructions on how to run your code.

When you are ready to submit to devpost, you will add the link to your GitHub repository so that our judges can analyse your work.

# **Competition Rules**

- Participants must be between the ages of 11 and 18 and be studying in a secondary school, Sixth Form or College based in one of London Boroughs
- Each group must be made up of 2-4 members and has to be gender-diverse, unless it is a single gender school, i.e. per group there must be a minimum of one boy and girl. Multi-ethnicity, children from BAME groups and on Free Schools Meals are encouraged, so are LGBT
- You must upload your video on YouTube and submit your video pitch no longer than 3 mins by 5 pm on May 24th on Devpost
- You must publish any and all code written on Github and provide links. You must document and provide an explanation of how it can be run.
- You must be able to demonstrate that everyone within your group has contributed.
- Parents are not allowed to mentor teams where participants are their children due to conflict of interest
- Code needs to be new and will be verified - it must not belong to any previous project

## **5. Business Model Canvas**

\*\*\*\*[Download our Business Model Guide PDF](http://bit.ly/2vkTfyS)

The Business Model Canvas (BMC), is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool. It allows you to describe, design, challenge, invent, and pivot your business model.

There are many resources on the web about the Business Model Canvas, here's a [Google search](https://www.google.com.au/webhp?q=business+model+canvas) to start you off.

[YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=business+model+canvas)has many very good video resources too.

A good starting place is on the Strategyzer site: https://strategyzer.com/canvas. Strategyzer have a lot of free resources on their site, but you'll need to register to access them.

Here are some videos to help you:

# **The Pitch Video**

\*\*\*\*[Download our Pitch Guide PDF](http://bit.ly/2vo0zK0)

Your pitch video is a core component of your Teens in AI Hack submissions, and should be a maximum of three (3) minutes.

You should aim to communicate your business canvas, demonstrate your prototype, and engage would-be users in 3 minutes. Use the video medium to create excitement and demand for your solution. What evidence can you provide or discuss that adds credibility to your team and your solution? Do you need more resources to take it to the next level – would your video attract crowd funding, the interest of an angel investors or philanthropist – or just get you on the news?

ALL participants needs to speak in the video!

You are encouraged to include your team name, team members, and to talk about how your project is innovative, has impact and relates to the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

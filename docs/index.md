# **Teens in AI Hackathon Guide**

!!! Info
	This site provides much of the information you'll need to prepare your Teens in AI Hack competition entries, and links to resources to help you create a great project.

## **What is Teens In AI London Tech Week Hackathon?**

To celebrate London Tech Week, [Founders4Schools](https://www.founders4schools.org.uk/about/), [Teens in AI](https://teensinai.com/) and [CogX](https://cogx.co/) are running a Hackathon to inspire young people aged 11-18 into Artificial Intelligence.

We are on a mission to encourage young people to pursue computing and technology, and promote diversity in this ever-growing field.

Diverse teams of 2-4 students will be designing a product that solves a challenge proposed with the use of AI, they will then go on to create this product and create a short 3-minute video pitching this product.

## **Challenges**

This year we are focusing on [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). Within their teams, young people can 
Focus on any one of the goals and tackle them using open source machine learning tools.

## **2. Ethics in AI**

## **3. Human-Centred Design**

Human-centered design is a creative approach to problem solving and the backbone of a product. It’s a process that starts with the people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs.

## **4. Business Model Canvas**

The Business Model Canvas (BMC), is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool. It allows you to describe, design, challenge, invent, and pivot your business model.

A good starting place is on the [Strategyzer](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas) sites. Strategyzer have a lot of free resources on their site, but you'll need to register to access them.

## **5. Tips for Pitch Video**

Your pitch video is a core component of your TeensInAI submissions, and should be a maximum of three (3) minutes.

You should aim to communicate your business canvas, demonstrate your product, and engage would-be users in 3 minutes. Use the video medium to create excitement and demand for your solution. What evidence can you provide or discuss that adds credibility to your team and your solution? Do you need more resources to take it to the next level – would your video attract crowd funding, the interest of an angel investors or philanthropist – or just get you on the news?

**Your pitch video should include:**

* Research Theme: How does your project relate to one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?
* Problem: What problem does your project solve?
* Vision: What is the vision for your business or product?
* Solution and Unique Value Proposition: How do you solve the problem you just defined? What is the unique value about your solution?
* Target Market: Who are you aiming this product at? How will it benefit them?
* product demo: Show us how your product works! What are its core technologies? Give us a demo!
* Project Team: Show us your team with their names and roles!

**Your pitch video could include (if you have time):**

* Market statistics of the industry your product or service will be a part of.
* Feedback or user stories surrounding your product/service.
* Short term (1 year) and long term (5 year) plans.
* Financial breakdown of costs including how much you would need from an investor.

**Some interesting points to consider when making your video:**

* Is your video showcasing the product/service and convincing to the viewer?
* Do you clearly identify the target market with justification?
* Do you convincingly explain why this idea is needed with justification?
* Do you showcase why this product/service is interesting?

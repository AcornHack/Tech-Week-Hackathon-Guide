# **Teens in AI Hackathon Guide**

!!! Info
	This site provides much of the information you'll need to prepare your Teens in AI Hack competition entries, and links to resources to help you create a great project.

## **What is Teens In AI London Tech Week Hackathon?**

To celebrate London Tech Week, [Founders4Schools](https://www.founders4schools.org.uk/about/), [Teens in AI](https://teensinai.com/) and [CogX](https://cogx.co/) are running a Hackathon to inspire young people aged 11-18 into Artificial Intelligence.

We are on a mission to encourage young people to pursue computing and technology, and promote diversity in this ever-growing field.

Diverse teams of 2-4 students will be designing a product that solves a challenge proposed with the use of AI, they will then go on to create this product and create a short 3-minute video pitching this product.

## **Challenges**

This year we are focusing on [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). Within their teams, young people can 
Focus on any one of the goals and tackle them using open source machine learning tools.

## **Judging Criteria**

Our panel of judges will analyse projects based on the criteria listed below. They will base their judgement on both the product you produce, the code you write and your video pitch.



* **Design & Implementation** - Does it work? Is it implementable? Did the team think about the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX)? Was the product designed with humans in mind?
* **Innovation:** How innovative / creative / unique is the idea? Was there a novel approach applied to solve the problem?
* **Technical Complexity** - Is the project technically impressive? Complex?  How technically sophisticated / advanced / elegant was the solution?
* **Social Impact** - How impactful is the idea? Can it impact the lives of many people in a significant way? Is the idea aligned with and addresses any of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?  
* **Commercial Viability** - Is there a business potential? How original is the business model? Has the team considered route to market and has made proactive actions to execute an action plan?  Is the idea feasible, does it have economic and societal value,
  and is it sustainable?

# **Teens in AI Competition Rules**

**1. Submitting**

1.1 DevPost is the Official Teens in AI competition submission site and allows you to submit all components required for your team’s entry. Note: submission elements and times are system controlled so no extensions are available!

1.2 Register all team members (including teacher & mentors) in DevPost (you'll need at least one person registered in DevPost to create and submit your project page).

1.3 Teams are required to submit the following as part of their competition entry on DevPost:

1.3.1 A descriptive project page in DevPost, listing your team members, with details about your project.

1.3.2 **A Business Model Canvas** (BMC) that lays out the elements of how your business idea and app could be brought to reality. When you are finished you'll have to upload an image of your canvas somewhere it can be accessed by our judges, (e.g. Google Docs, OneDrive, DropBox), and link to it from your DevPost project page.

1.3.3 **A Software Application**. This can be anything, e.g. a website, a mobile app, a game. You'll need to host your app somewhere that it can be viewed or download by our judges, and link to it from your DevPost project page. We suggest you use one of the many free or trial services available from the likes of Google, Azure, OpenShift, Heroku, GitHub, etc. (NB: Teens in AI does not provide any app hosting facilities.) Tip: your team should familiarise themselves with your hosting platform before the competition weekend.

1.3.4 **A Pitch Video** (maximum three minutes) that explains your Business Model Canvas and demos your app. You'll need to shoot and edit your video using your own equipment – laptop and phone camera quality will be fine. You'll also need to upload your video to YouTube (or similar) for our judges to view, and link to it from your DevPost project page. Remember that the judging panel is viewing the videos in isolation and doesn’t necessarily have any context around your project. You may mix in other elements with the screen-cast, such as footage demonstrating the issues your projects addresses, interviews, live action material you’ve filmed, et cetera – but be aware that videos that don’t focus on showing off the project itself will not be as valued as ones that do. Check out the hacker toolkit for some assistance and instruction on how to make a compelling video. 

1.3.5 Outcomes from the project itself (any code, graphics, mashups, applications, website URLs, photos of each stage to create your artistic representation etc.). If judges are able to see and play with it that is useful, but this is a minor component of the judging. Teams can put the code/source on GitHub, Bitbucket, Sourceforge or an equivalent repository system and must make the URL available on their project page for verification. For artistic works you may need to create a photo library or share a link to a Googledocs or similar that contains evidence of the stages of your project.

## **2. Ethics in AI**

## **3. Human-Centred Design**

Human-centered design is a creative approach to problem solving and the backbone of a product. It’s a process that starts with the people you’re designing for and ends with new solutions that are tailor made to suit their needs.

[Download our Human Centred Design Guide PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zpjIXhG5X6DtwytUJwC8UqgG-SibMXEU)

## **4. Business Model Canvas**

The Business Model Canvas (BMC), is a strategic management and entrepreneurial tool. It allows you to describe, design, challenge, invent, and pivot your business model.

A good starting place is on the [Strategyzer](https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas) sites. Strategyzer have a lot of free resources on their site, but you'll need to register to access them.

## **5. Tips for Pitch Video**

Your pitch video is a core component of your TeensInAI submissions, and should be a maximum of three (3) minutes.

You should aim to communicate your business canvas, demonstrate your product, and engage would-be users in 3 minutes. Use the video medium to create excitement and demand for your solution. What evidence can you provide or discuss that adds credibility to your team and your solution? Do you need more resources to take it to the next level – would your video attract crowd funding, the interest of an angel investors or philanthropist – or just get you on the news?

**Your pitch video should include:**

* Research Theme: How does your project relate to one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals?
* Problem: What problem does your project solve?
* Vision: What is the vision for your business or product?
* Solution and Unique Value Proposition: How do you solve the problem you just defined? What is the unique value about your solution?
* Target Market: Who are you aiming this product at? How will it benefit them?
* product demo: Show us how your product works! What are its core technologies? Give us a demo!
* Project Team: Show us your team with their names and roles!

**Your pitch video could include (if you have time):**

* Market statistics of the industry your product or service will be a part of.
* Feedback or user stories surrounding your product/service.
* Short term (1 year) and long term (5 year) plans.
* Financial breakdown of costs including how much you would need from an investor.

**Some interesting points to consider when making your video:**

* Is your video showcasing the product/service and convincing to the viewer?
* Do you clearly identify the target market with justification?
* Do you convincingly explain why this idea is needed with justification?
* Do you showcase why this product/service is interesting?

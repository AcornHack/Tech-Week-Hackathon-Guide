# **Teens in AI Hackathon Guide**

!!! Info
	This site provides much of the information you'll need to prepare your Teens in AI Hack competition entries, and links to resources to help you create a great project.

## **What is Teens In AI London Tech Week Hackathon?**

To celebrate London Tech Week, [Founders4Schools](https://www.founders4schools.org.uk/about/), [Teens in AI](https://teensinai.com/) and [CogX](https://cogx.co/) are running a Hackathon to inspire young people aged 11-18 into Artificial Intelligence.

We are on a mission to encourage young people to pursue computing and technology, and promote diversity in this ever-growing field.

Diverse teams of 2-4 students will be designing a product that solves a challenge proposed with the use of AI, they will then go on to create this product and create a short 3-minute video pitching this product.

## **Challenges**

This year we are focusing on [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/). Within their teams, young people can 
Focus on any one of the goals and tackle them using open source machine learning tools.

## **Judging Criteria**

Our panel of judges will analyse projects based on the criteria listed below. They will base their judgement on both the product you produce, the code you write and your video pitch.

* Implementation
* Originality
* Technical Complexity
* Social Impact

## **Prizes**

* **Pitch at [CogX](https://cogx.co)** - Pitch your project at CogX to investors, developers and industry experts. You never know, a good pitch could get your business up and running in no time!
* **Attend [Pitch@Palace](https://pitchatpalace.com/)** - Attend Pitch@Palace! You'll have the opportunity to mingle with world-renowned entrepreneurs! 
* **Work Experience via [Workfinder](https://www.workfinder.com/)** - Gain work experience in the field of your choice with our partner Workfinder!
* **Use of [Tech Nation Digital Business Academy](https://digitalbusinessacademy.technation.io/)** - Use Technation's Digital Business Academy Platform to expand your know-how and skills in ever-growing tech markets.

## **How to Enter**

1. Create teams of 2-4 students - max 2 teams per school
2. Host an event 10-24 May and invite mentors (2-3 machine learning and artificial intelligence Developers, 1-2 Design Thinkers, 1-2 Entrepreneurs, 1-2 Ethicists) to ideate and help you submit videos by 24 May on DevPost (submission rules and Devpost link to be shared)
3. If your team is selected into 20 Finalist teams, it will be invited to CogX AI Festival for inspiration on Monday morning 10 June
4. Teams will return to school and carry on building their projects with the help of mentors
5. Teams will submit a video pitch of their final project on 11th June by 5 pm on Devpost (link to be shared)

## **DevPost**

Teens in AI Hack will use [DevPost](https://devpost.com) to manage project submissions for judging. DevPost is a free service for managing hackathons and project pages.

## **GitHub**

Teams will upload all code to GitHub. GitHub is a tool that developers and teams use to work together on their projects. You must use GitHub to store your code. Doing this is very simple. You must also attach a README.md to GitHub with instructions on how to run your code.

When you are ready to submit to devpost, you will add the link to your GitHub repository so that our judges can analyse your work.

## **Rules**

* Participants must be between the ages of 11 and 18 and be studying in a secondary school, Sixth Form or College based in one of London Boroughs
* Each group must be made up of 2-4 members and has to be gender-diverse, unless it is a single gender school, i.e. per group there must be a minimum of one boy and girl. Multi-ethnicity, children from BAME groups and on Free Schools Meals are encouraged, so are LGBT
* You must upload your video on YouTube and submit your video pitch no longer than 3 mins by 5 pm on May 24th for Round 1 and 5 pm June 11th for the Final Round.
* You must publish any and all code written on Github and provide links. You must document and provide an explanation of how it can be run.
* You must be able to demonstrate that everyone within your group has contributed.
* Parents are not allowed to mentor teams where participants are their children due to conflict of interest
* Code needs to be new and will be verified - it must not belong to any previous project
* You are not expected to build a fully working product, but a Minimum Viable Product - a working prototype
